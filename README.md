# farmer-market
The goal is to build a project that allow farmers to easily sell their produce, set a event, adjust prices, etc.

Backend code to connect with React frontend code

Developed a java backend from scratch for a local ordering/delivery system, adding ability to set events, rank and leave review of most popular products, change price.
Able to call to frontend using REST API.

JUnit tested all methods in all classes.

Added an example UI because I don't know how to make a GUI

Note: First time working with backend code (like RestAPI) specifically to connect to front end. 
Had no guidelines while coding so very rough code.
